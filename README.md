The most productive cities in America happen to be the most expensive ones. New York and San Francisco are the two most expensive cities in America, yet have some of the best job opportunities in the country. How did we get here? 

As it turns out, no, it's not that these cities are "land-constrained", or that they're "earthquake-prone". It's a much simpler explanation, one that tells the story of America and its unwillingness to accompany its growing population in places where it makes the most sense to. 

- Job growth / US population growth vs Housing growth in city centers (urban areas) 
- Huge mismatch 
- numbers that est how much housing we need 
- LA added 10k+ units in 1930s 
- LA max capacity used to be 10M, now it's 3M

- Prop 13 in California: incentive to not approve housing, office instead,

## FAQ

- What about luxury condos? 
small part of the problem, the actual middle-housing (small apartments, duplexes, etc) that's affordable is effectively banned in most cities. [40% of Manhattan couldn
't be built today](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/19/upshot/forty-percent-of-manhattans-buildings-could-not-be-built-today.html?_r=0)

- What about rent control? 
98% of economists agree that rent control drives up rent for people not on rent control [cite]. Keeps long-term tenants safe in their homes, while dispersing the costs to people who aren't already locked in to long-term homes, which tend to be younger people in search of opportunity. 

- Doesn't market-rate housing displace people? 
Communities that build mkt-rate have less displacement than those that don't [CA mkt-rate study] [](http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3345). Most market-rate housing also is required to dedicate some % of housing to low-income residents. 

- Inclusionary housing? 
Effective when paired with some upzoning. Ineffective / kills housing when not. SF has seen housing applications plummet after increasing inclusionary req to 25%. Most projects won't pencil out with so much requirements.
