The most productive cities in America happen to be the most expensive ones. New York, San Francisco are the two most expensive cities in America, yet have some of the best job opportunities in the country. How did we get here? 

As it turns out, no, it's not that these cities are "land-constrained", or that they're "earthquake-prone". It's a much simpler explanation, one that tells the story of America and its unwillingness to accompany its growing population in places where it makes the most sense to.
